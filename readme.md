# Installation #

After cloning this repository, run
```
$ npm run setup
```

This will run `npm install && bower install && tsd install` so you have all the
dependencies required for this boilerplate.

### Development workflow ###

Run `gulp watch` and it will open in a browser once initial build is complete
and will then continue to watch for file changes and refresh your browser
once webpack has repacked after the changes.
